# Summon API Demo projects

This repository contains a collection of individual projects written in different programming languages.  All of these projects are designed to demonstrate interactions with the Summon Search API.  Individual language-specific folders within this repository have their own README files providing detailed instructions.

Note that in order to use any of these projects, you will need to be a current Summon customer with valid API authentication credentials. If you do not already have these credentials, see the following Ex Libris Knowledge Center article:
